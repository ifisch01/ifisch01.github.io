README FILE FOR ONLINE PROFILE HOSTED AT ifisch01.github.io.
www.cs.tufts.edu/~ifisch01/ REDIRECTS TO THIS SITE.

AS OF TODAY, ALL OF THE FILES HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY VALIDATED AND DISPLAYED NO ERROR MESSAGES. ALL ASPECTS OF THE ASSIGNMENT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED.

THERE WAS NO COLLABORATION FROM ANY OTHER STUDENTS, BUT I LOOKED UP HOW TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN PARTS OF THE CSS CODE FROM CSS-TRICKS.

I SPENT APPROXIMATELY 15 HOURS ON THIS ASSIGNMENT, GIVEN THAT IT TOOK TIME TO UNDERSTAND HOW GIT WORKED AND APPLY CHANGES TO THE DOCUMENT.

IN THE FUTURE, I HOPE TO MAKE THE LINKS MORE INTUITIVE TO THE USER AND HAVE THE RESUME FORMATTED SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY.
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO HAVE A CONTACT ME OPTION, AN OPTION TO DOWNLOAD A COPY OF THE RESUME AND POTENTIALLY CHANGE THE PHOTO.
