<h2>About me...</h2>
<header>
</header>
<p>Hello! My name is Isaiah and I am from Chapel Hill, North Carolina and a current Sophomore at Tufts University. I am studying Computer Science and Engineering Psychology, an interdisciplinary major that applies attributes of human behavior to consumer product design. I am really interested in design thinking and the interaction between humans and technology, specifically with the intersection of healthcare delivery and how it can be improved through better software and a more intuitive user interface.</p>
<p>I love to travel, speak Spanish and go outside, even if Boston is mad cold. I retired from Basketball in 8th grade and have been looking for new professional avenues, opportunities, and career paths ever since. What a time to be alive! </p>
